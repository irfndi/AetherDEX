This document outlines the test coverage goals and tracks the results for the AetherDEX smart contracts.

## Coverage Goals

*   **Target:** Aim for >95% line, branch, and function coverage.
*   **Priority:** Focus on achieving 100% coverage for security-critical components, including:
    *   Funds transfer logic (`AetherPool`, `AetherRouter`)
    *   Access control mechanisms (`Ownable`, hook permissions)
    *   State-changing functions
    *   Cross-chain interaction logic

## Coverage Reports

*   **[TODO]** Add summaries of `forge coverage` reports here periodically. Include overall percentages and highlight any significant gaps in critical areas.

*(This file will be updated as coverage is assessed and improved.)*

# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is AetherDEX?
AetherDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform that enables users to trade cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchain networks with low fees and high security.

### How does AetherDEX differ from other DEXs?
AetherDEX differentiates itself through advanced cross-chain capabilities, optimized trading routes, minimal slippage, and a focus on user experience. Our architecture combines the best aspects of order book and AMM models.

### Which blockchains does AetherDEX support?
Currently, AetherDEX supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche. We're continually expanding our support for additional chains.

## Trading

### What types of orders can I place?
AetherDEX supports market orders, limit orders, stop orders, and conditional orders through our advanced trading interface.

### How are trading fees calculated?
Trading fees are typically 0.3%, with 0.25% going to liquidity providers and 0.05% to the protocol treasury. Fees may be lower based on trading volume and AetherDEX token holdings.

### How long do transactions take?
Transaction times vary based on the underlying blockchain networks. Most transactions are confirmed within 30 seconds, but cross-chain swaps may take 2-5 minutes depending on the chains involved.

## Wallets and Security

### Which wallets are supported?
AetherDEX supports MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, and other major Web3 wallets.

### How secure is AetherDEX?
AetherDEX contracts have undergone multiple security audits and implement formal verification techniques. We never take custody of user funds, and all trading happens directly through smart contracts.

### What happens if I lose access to my wallet?
AetherDEX is non-custodial, meaning we don't store your private keys or have access to your funds. If you lose access to your wallet, you'll need to use your wallet's recovery methods (seed phrase).

## Liquidity Provision

### How can I provide liquidity?
You can provide liquidity by depositing paired assets into any available liquidity pool through the "Pools" section of the interface.

### What are the risks of providing liquidity?
Liquidity providers may experience impermanent loss if the price ratio of the paired assets changes significantly. Please research and understand these risks before providing liquidity.

### How are liquidity provider rewards calculated?
Liquidity providers earn a share of the 0.25% trading fees proportional to their contribution to the pool. Additional incentives may be available through yield farming programs.

## Technical Support

### How do I get help if I encounter a problem?
For technical support, please join our Discord community or submit a support ticket through the website. You can also check our documentation for solutions to common issues.

### Can I recover funds sent to the wrong address?
Unfortunately, blockchain transactions are irreversible. AetherDEX cannot recover funds sent to incorrect addresses.

### How do I report a bug or security vulnerability?
Please report bugs through GitHub issues. For security vulnerabilities, please email security@aetherdex.com with details of the potential exploit.

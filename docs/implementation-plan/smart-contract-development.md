# Smart Contract Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

This document outlines the plan for the ongoing development and improvement of the AetherDEX smart contracts. The primary goals are to ensure robustness, security, and comprehensive test coverage, adhering to the guidelines specified in `.cursor/rules/global-rules.mdc`. This plan will be updated as development progresses.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Test Coverage:** Ensuring high test coverage across all smart contracts is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring functional correctness.
- **Complex Interactions:** Smart contracts often have complex interactions. Tests need to cover these interactions thoroughly.
- **Gas Optimization:** While not the primary focus of this initial plan, future iterations may require analysis and optimization for gas usage.
- **Security Audits:** Preparing for and addressing findings from security audits will be an ongoing challenge.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  **Establish Baseline:**
    *   [ ] Create this `smart-contract-development.md` document.
    *   [ ] Verify all existing smart contract tests pass.
    *   [ ] Generate an initial test coverage report.
2.  **Improve Test Coverage:**
    *   [ ] Identify contracts/functions with low coverage.
    *   [ ] Write and implement new tests to cover these areas.
    *   [ ] Ensure all new tests pass.
    *   [ ] Re-generate test coverage report and confirm improvement.
3.  **Ongoing Maintenance & Feature Development (Placeholder):**
    *   [ ] (Future tasks related to new features or refactoring will be added here)

## Project Status Board

*   [ ] **Phase 1: Test Audit and Enhancement**
    *   [x] Create `smart-contract-development.md` - *(This task)*
    *   [x] Verify existing test suite: All tests pass.
    *   [ ] Generate initial test coverage report.
    *   [ ] Identify critical areas for new tests.
    *   [ ] Implement new tests for [Specify Area 1].
    *   [ ] Implement new tests for [Specify Area 2].
    *   [ ] Achieve target test coverage (e.g., 80%).

*   [ ] **Phase 2: (Future Planning)**
    *   [ ] ...

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

All 116 Foundry smart contract tests passed after installing vyper==0.3.10. Solidity compiler warnings were observed but did not affect test outcomes.

# AetherDEX Backend Web Services

This document outlines the backend web services for AetherDEX, including their architecture, roadmap, and technology stack.

## Overview

The backend web services for AetherDEX are built using Hono and Cloudflare Workers to provide a serverless, scalable, and cost-effective backend. This service will handle API requests from the frontend, manage off-chain data, and integrate with Cloudflare's suite of services for storage and data management.

## Architecture

The backend web services are designed with the following principles:

-   **Serverless & Scalable:** Leveraging Cloudflare Workers for automatic scaling and global distribution.
-   **Cost-Effective:** Utilizing Cloudflare Workers' pay-as-you-go model for optimal cost efficiency.
-   **Reliability & Resilience:** Implementing proxy and circuit breaker patterns for enhanced reliability and fault tolerance.
-   **Integration with Cloudflare Services:** Utilizing Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare KV for fast key-value storage, and Cloudflare D1 for serverless SQL database when needed.

### Potential Features

-   **Analytics Dashboard API:** Provide API endpoints for real-time DEX analytics, including trading volumes, liquidity data, and user statistics, to be displayed on the frontend dashboard.
-   **Data Aggregation & Indexing:** Aggregate and index on-chain data from the Polygon zkEVM network to facilitate efficient data retrieval and querying, making relevant blockchain data readily accessible for the frontend.
-   **API Gateway & Proxy:** Act as an API gateway for the frontend, providing a secure and unified interface for accessing smart contracts and backend services. Implement proxy patterns to manage and optimize requests to the smart contracts.
-   **Circuit Breaker Implementation:** Implement circuit breaker patterns to enhance system resilience and prevent cascading failures in case of backend service disruptions or smart contract issues.

## Uniswap V4 Architectural Alignment

### Hook Architecture Implementation
- **Custom Pool Logic**: Design hook contracts for:
  - Dynamic fee structures
  - TWAP oracle integration
  - Custom LP position management
- **Singleton Contract Pattern**: Single factory contract deployment across chains
- **ERC-1155 Accounting**: Multi-token balance management for cross-chain liquidity

### Multi-Chain Foundation
1. **Chain-Agnostic Core**:
   - Abstracted network-specific implementations
   - Universal liquidity pool interface
2. **Cross-Chain Message Relaying**:
   - LayerZero integration for cross-chain swaps
   - CCIP read compatibility
3. **Multi-Chain Data Aggregation**:
   - Normalized blockchain data schema
   - Chain-specific adapters (EVM/SVM)

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)

-   **Initial Setup:** Set up the backend web project with Hono.
-   **Cloudflare Workers Deployment:** Configure and deploy the backend API to Cloudflare Workers.
-   **Basic API Endpoints:** Implement essential API endpoints for health checks and basic data retrieval, ensuring the backend is functional and ready for integration.
-   **Cloudflare KV Integration:** Integrate Cloudflare KV for caching and fast data access for frequently requested data.

### Phase 1.5: V4 Hook Development
- Custom swap validation hooks
- Time-weighted market maker (TWAMM) integration
- Gas-optimized flash accounting system

### Phase 2: Analytics and Indexing

-   **Analytics API Development:** Develop and deploy API endpoints to collect, process, and serve DEX analytics data, providing valuable insights into DEX performance and user behavior.
-   **Data Indexing Service Implementation:** Implement a robust service to index blockchain data, enabling efficient querying and retrieval of on-chain information for the frontend.
-   **Cloudflare D1 Integration (if needed):** Integrate Cloudflare D1 for structured data storage and management, providing a serverless SQL database solution for more complex data requirements.

### Phase 2.5: Cross-Chain Validation
- Universal hook interface testing
- Multi-chain liquidity mirroring
- Cross-network fee consistency checks

### Phase 3: Advanced Backend Features

-   **Advanced API Features:** Expand API capabilities to support advanced DEX features, such as historical data analysis, advanced order types, and personalized user data.
-   **Multi-Chain Data Aggregation:** Extend backend services to aggregate and analyze data from multiple blockchain networks, providing a comprehensive multi-chain overview of DEX activity.
-   **Optimized Performance & Scalability:** Continuously optimize backend performance and scalability to handle increasing data volumes and API request loads as the AetherDEX platform grows.

## Technology Stack

-   **Web Framework:** Hono
-   **Serverless Platform:** Cloudflare Workers
-   **Data Storage:** Cloudflare KV, Cloudflare D1 (for future scalability)
-   **Proxy and Circuit Breaker Patterns:** For reliability and resilience.
-   **V4-Core**: Forked Uniswap V4-core with multi-chain modifications
-   **ERC-7561**: Minimal multi-chain token standard compliance
-   **Chainlink CCIP**: Cross-chain infrastructure foundation
-   **Hyperlane**: Multi-chain message verification

# AetherDEX Blockchain - Smart Contracts

This document provides an overview of the smart contracts for AetherDEX, including their architecture, roadmap, and technology stack.

## Overview

AetherDEX smart contracts are written in Solidity and use Foundry for development, testing, and deployment. They form the core logic of the decentralized exchange, implementing core DEX features like swapping, limit orders, liquidity pools, and fee collection. **A key design aspect of these contracts is their flexibility and robustness, incorporating upgradeability and rollback mechanisms from the outset, along with security and multi-chain support.** The contracts are designed to be upgradeable, rollbackable, secure, and support multi-chain deployment.

## Architecture

The smart contracts are designed with the following principles in mind:

-   **Simplicity:** Focus on core DEX functionality for the MVP.
-   **Efficiency:** Optimize for low gas costs and fast execution on Polygon zkEVM.
-   **Scalability:** Design contracts to be scalable for future features and multi-chain expansion.
-   **Security:** Implement robust security measures, including best practices, audits, and circuit breakers.
-   **Upgradability:** Utilize proxy patterns for seamless contract upgrades and version management.
-   **Multi-Chain Compatibility:** Architect contracts to be adaptable for deployment across multiple EVM-compatible chains.

## Roadmap

AetherDEX smart contracts are being developed in three phases, mirroring the overall project roadmap:

### Phase 1: Build on Polygon zkEVM (MVP)

-   **Core Features:** (as defined in Project Overview)
    -   Basic DEX features (Swap, Limit Buy/Sell)
    -   Connect Wallet
    -   Multi-Chain Support
    -   Upgradable Smart Contracts
    -   Revert/Rollback Mechanism
    -   Circuit Breaker
-   **Tech Stack:** Solidity, Foundry, Polygon zkEVM Cardona.
-   **Deployment:** 
    -   Deploy on Polygon zkEVM Cardona Testnet for testing and validation.
    -   Deploy on Polygon zkEVM Cardona Mainnet with initial liquidity pools.

### Phase 2: Optimize and Scale on Polygon zkEVM

-   **Advanced Features:**
    -   Implement Concentrated Liquidity (Uniswap V3-style pools) for enhanced capital efficiency.
    -   Enable Staking and Yield Farming mechanisms for liquidity providers.
    -   Explore Cross-Chain Swap integration for seamless asset transfers.

### Phase 3: Multi-Chain Expansion

-   **Expand Smart Contract Deployment to other Networks:**
    -   Solana: Explore deployment on Solana for high-speed, low-fee trading.
    -   Ethereum: Consider deployment on Ethereum Layer 2s (zkEVM, Optimism/Arbitrum) for wider reach.
    -   Binance Smart Chain (BSC): Evaluate deployment on BSC for retail user access.

## Technology Stack

-   **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity (latest stable version)
-   **Development & Testing Framework:** Foundry
-   **Security Libraries:** OpenZeppelin
-   **Target Blockchains:** Polygon zkEVM Cardona (initial focus), Solana, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

## Testing and Deployment

-   **Rigorous Testing:** All smart contracts must achieve 100% test coverage using Foundry before mainnet deployment.
-   **Testnet Validation:** Deployments to Polygon zkEVM Cardona Testnet will undergo thorough testing and validation.
-   **Audited Mainnet Deployment:** Mainnet deployment on Polygon zkEVM Cardona will occur only after security audits and comprehensive testing.
